# Kalman filtering to reduce measurement noise of sample entropy: An electroencephalographic study

This is the matlab code implementation of our paper "Kalman filtering to reduce measurement noise of  sample entropy: An electroencephalographic study"

## Datasets
The data used in this study includes the [sleep signals](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/) , [epilepsy signals](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/), and synthetic signals . 


## Requirements
-  Matlab
-  [NNetEn calculator 1.0.0.4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366575849_NNetEn_calculator_1004_for_NNetEn_calculation_with_six_matrix_filling_methods)
